### Waddup, it's Tired Newin
 
- Data-driven dreamer tryna bring order to spreadsheet chaos — and sometimes life.  
- Ex-BA/BI/DA — did the rounds, now I’m the CEO of Ctrl+C and clean data.  
- Can spot a bad chart faster than spotting a fyneshi 🤫.  
- Running on SQL and vibes — caffeine’s just emotional support at this point.  
---

#### Tech stack I vibe with:
- **Languages:** SQL, Excel formulas that hit different
- **Tools:** Excel (still bussin), BigQuery, Google Sheets (living rent-free in my tabs)
- **Bonus:** Jupyter, VS Code (iykyk)

#### Currently leveling up:
- Python (big glow-up incoming 🐍)  
- Building dashboards that pass the vibe check *and* don’t crash — no, like for real

#### Fun facts:
- Built a snack-tracking dashboard and called it "research"  
- `Ctrl + Z` is the real MVP  
- Cleaning data is my villain origin story and therapy arc  
- Charted my sleep pattern once — didn’t survive the roast

Drop a 👍 if the vibe’s a W — or just lurk like it’s your side quest 🤡*
